# makestream
ffmpeg wrapper to generate a more streaming friendly version of video files. This is specific to my use case, converting 1080p video from my recorder down to 720p. See parameters set in the code for ffmpeg and to adjust the data reduction method. A 26 minute video weighing in at 4.5 GB slims down to 424 MB and looks good enough for streaming, esp. on smartphones and tablets.
