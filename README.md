# makestream
ffmpeg wrapper to generate a more streaming friendly version of video files. This is specific to my use case, converting 1080p video from my recorder down to 720p. See comments in the code about ffmpeg parameters. A 26 minute video weighing in at 4.5 GB slims down to 424 MB and looks decent enough.
